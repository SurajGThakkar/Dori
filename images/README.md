## Image Guidelines

- Use high-quality images with good lighting
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios within each category
- Recommended formats: JPEG for photographs, PNG for graphics with transparency
- Optimize file sizes for web performance
- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `red-silk-saree.jpg` instead of `img001.jpg`)

## Placeholder Images

Currently, the site uses placeholder images from Unsplash. When replacing these with actual product images:

1. Match the dimensions and aspect ratio of the placeholders
2. Update the image paths in the corresponding component files
3. Ensure proper attribution is removed for Unsplash images
